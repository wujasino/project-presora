/**
 * Single source of truth for subscription pricing.
 *
 * Extracted from Pricing.tsx once the landing page started showing plans
 * too: two hand-maintained copies of the same numbers drift the moment a
 * price changes, and a landing page quoting a price the checkout doesn't
 * honour is the worst possible place for that to happen.
 *
 * `id` matches the Stripe price-ID lookup in Pricing.tsx's handlePlanSelect
 * and the plan values in netlify/functions/admin-update-user.js's
 * VALID_PLANS — note "Business" is `growth` and "Agency" is `enterprise`
 * internally, so don't rename ids to match the display names.
